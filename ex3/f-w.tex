\noindent There are many positive integer solutions to the equation
\[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
\noindent which can be rewritten as
\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]
\noindent For example (3,4,5) or (5,12,13). Such solutions are called \emph{Pythagorean triples}.

\noindent However, for higher powers the situation is very different, and we have:-

\textbf{Theorem: Fermat-Wiles}

\noindent For all natural numbers \(n \geq 3\), there are no integers \emph{x,y,z} satisfying the equation
\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]
